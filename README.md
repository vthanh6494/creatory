Thank you for taking the time to work on our assignment.

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is for us to get a better idea of your ability while not taking too much of your time.

## Requirements

We like programmers who are curious and comfortable with new technology. We'd love for you to use the new Next.js app directory. But if you feel more comfortable with the traditional pages structure then go for it! In case you do not have enough time feel free to skip parts of the assignment.

The criteria on which you are judged:

1. The simplicity and structure of your state
2. How well you use the Next.js features such as SSR
3. Readability of your code
4. Performance for the user
5. How well you use components
6. Selection of your libraries and frameworks

Bonus points for a beautiful application.
